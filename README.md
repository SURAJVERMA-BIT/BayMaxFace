# BayMaxFace

This project recreates Baymax's face with expression using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The face changes expressions automatically every 2 seconds to 6 seconds.

## Features
- Baymax's face with animated eyes and line expressions
- Smooth transitions between emotions
- Fully responsive design
- Simple and clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BayMaxFace.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd BayMaxFace
   ```
3. Open `Baymax.Html` in your browser:
   ```sh
   open BayMax.html
   ```
   OR
   ```sh
   start BayMax.html
   ``` (Windows)

## Usage
- The animation automatically cycles through different emotions.
- The JavaScript controls the timing and transformation of the eyes and connecting line.
- No additional setup is required; just open the `BayMax.html` file and see it in action!

## Customization
If you want to tweak the expressions:
- Modify the `blink()` function in `script.js` to adjust timing or add new expressions.
- Change the `CSS` styles to alter the appearance of Baymaxâ€™s face.
- Adjust the transition speeds in `animation` properties inside `styles.css`.

## Future Improvements
- Add manual controls to switch between emotions.
- Include sound effects for each emotion change.
- Make it interactive with user inputs (hover, click, or voice control).
